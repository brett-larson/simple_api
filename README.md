# Simple API (ICT4310: Week 4 Assignment)
This repository contains basic Python code and Postman tests to demonstrate communication between a client and server using GET and POST methods.

## Requirements
The simple API server is written in Python using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The application utilizes [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), which will be necessary for starting and running the server. In addition, the Python [Cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library is used to enable SSL. 

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is required for testing the API web server. Import the Postman JSON file, which is located in the postman_collection folder.

## To Run
The follow steps detail how to run and test the API server.
1. Ensure the two Python files are placed in the same directory
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed
3. Run the api_server.py file
4. In Postman, import the Postman JSON file
5. Run the test cases in the Postman collection
