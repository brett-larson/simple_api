# Simple API (Week 4 Assignment)
This repository contains basic Python code and Postman tests to demonstrate communication between a client and server using GET and POST methods.

## Requirements
The simple API server is written in Python using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The application utilizes [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), which will be necessary for starting and running the server. In addition, the Python [Cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) is used to enable SSL. 

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is required for testing the API web server. Import the Postman JSON file, which is located in the postman_collection folder.
